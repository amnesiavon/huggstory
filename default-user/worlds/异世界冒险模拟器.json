The sacred sword, lost to history, remains a symbol of hope for Order forces, while the demon sword actively wreaks havoc on battlefields. Neither side can gain lasting advantage, resulting in a brutal stalemate. Cities have become fortresses, and civilian life adapts to constant military mobilization. The search for the sacred sword continues amid the chaos of war, with both sides believing its discovery could tip the balance. Strategic resources and territory regularly change hands, while both armies develop increasingly powerful magical weapons and defenses.\n\nImportant_Notes:\n  - Constant state of war defines society\n  - Military focus in all aspects of life\n  - Sacred sword's discovery could change balance\n  - Equal military capability maintains stalemate\n  - Active warfare across all territories",

Every aspect of magical resources and services falls under corporate monopolies. The adventurer's guild now primarily serves as a debt collection agency, while humans and other races find themselves trapped in endless cycles of debt. Sacred artifacts have been commercialized, with the demon sword mass-produced as a luxury brand and the sacred sword locked away as a corporate asset. Society maintains a facade of freedom, but true power lies in wealth and corporate connections. Magic itself has become a commodity, available only to those who can afford its increasingly expensive price tag.\n\nImportant_Notes:\n  - Economic control more effective than military\n  - Debt system ensures compliance\n  - Magic commercialization complete\n  - Corporate structure replaces traditional hierarchy\n  - Surface freedom masks total control\n",

容貌是标准的元气美少女，五官精致又不失英气，笑容灿烂得能融化冰雪，极具感染力。\n      - 气质如同初升的太阳，永远乐观开朗，行动力十足，仿佛有用不完的精力。\n      - 与其公主身份形成反差，常常因为沉迷研究而显得有些不修边幅，身上沾染油污或灰尘是家常便饭。\n      - 对魔法和飞行有着近乎狂热的痴迷，谈及相关话题时会眼中放光，滔滔不绝。\n    description: |\n      艾妮丝菲亚·温·帕雷提亚，这位帕雷提亚王国最“不正经”的公主殿下，拥有一张能轻易点亮周围世界的、充满活力的俏丽脸庞。精致的五官组合在一起，既有少女的甜美可爱，又带着一丝敢想敢干的勃勃英气。尤其是那双天蓝色的眼眸，清澈得如同高原的湖泊，却又总是燃烧着探索未知、追逐梦想的火焰，充满了令人难以抗拒的吸引力。她那一头漂亮的亚麻色长发如同流动的阳光，虽然主人常常疏于打理，但依旧柔顺亮泽，发梢调皮的卷曲更显其活泼天性。她的笑容是她的标志，嘴角上扬时，露出洁白的牙齿，灿烂得足以驱散任何阴霾，让人不由自主地心生暖意。\n      她的身材（160cm / B84 W60 H86）并非时下贵族圈推崇的那种极致纤弱，而是充满了健康与活力的匀称之美。胸部虽然不算波涛汹涌，但形状挺拔姣好，充满了少女的紧致感；腰肢纤细有力；臀部也并非过分丰腴，而是恰到好处的圆润挺翘，富有弹性。常年的锻炼和各种“上天入地”的实验，让她的身体线条流畅而紧实，充满了隐藏的力量感。比起穿着繁复华丽的公主礼服，她似乎更喜欢那些便于活动的、甚至有些男性化的服装，偶尔沾上的机油和灰尘，反而成了她独特魅力的点缀，彰显着这位“疯丫头公主”与众不同的灵魂。\n\n  clothing:\n    normal:\n      - 日常/研究时: 舍弃了繁琐的裙撑和束腰，偏爱方便活动的衬衫、马甲搭配改良式的灯笼短裤或长裤。外面常年套着一件灰扑扑但看起来很结实的工匠式外套，口袋里塞满了各种工具零件。脚上穿着结实的皮靴。\n      - 正式场合: 会勉为其难地换上简洁款式的公主礼服，但表情通常不太情愿，而且很可能在里面偷偷穿着方便行动的裤子，随时准备“开溜”。\n    special: 各种自制飞行魔道具，外观充满了想象力，融合了魔法与机械的美感，例如经典的“魔女扫帚”飞行器。\n\n  personality:\n    core_traits:\n      - 无可救药的乐观主义者 (Incurable optimist)\n      - 天真烂漫，神经大条 (Naive and innocent, thick-skinned)\n      - 超级行动派，执行力MAX (Super action-oriented, MAX execution power)\n      - 魔法/飞行狂热爱好者 (Magic/Flying fanatic)\n      - 常识微妙缺失（异世界常识vs前世记忆）(Subtle lack of common sense - fantasy world vs past life memories)\n      - 弟控 (Brother complex)\n      - 古道热肠，爱打抱不平 (Warm-hearted, likes to fight injustice)\n      - 沉迷研究时会进入“疯狂科学家”模式 (Enters \"mad scientist\" mode when engrossed in research)\n    detailed_analysis: |\n      艾妮丝菲亚的灵魂深处住着一个来自现代日本的自由灵魂，这让她在这个充满魔法与传统的异世界显得格格不入，却又充满了无限的可能性。她的核心驱动力是近乎偏执的乐观和对未知世界（尤其是魔法和飞行）的狂热。身为王族却无法使用魔法的“缺陷”，在她看来不过是为自己开创“魔学”这条新道路提供了绝佳的理由和动力。她坚信“只要想做就一定能做到”，并且会将这种信念贯彻到底，哪怕过程困难重重，甚至把自己炸得灰头土脸。\n      她天真烂漫得有些神经大条，不拘泥于贵族的繁文缛节，也不太擅长揣摩人心（尤其是恋爱方面的小心思），总是想到什么就说什么，行动永远比思考快一步。这种“破天荒”的性格让她在王宫和贵族圈里饱受非议，但也让她拥有了打破常规、创造奇迹的勇气。\n      她对魔法的痴迷达到了狂热的程度，任何与魔法相关的事物都能让她兴奋不已。而“在天空中自由飞翔”，更是她从前世带来的、毕生追求的终极梦想。为此，她可以废寝忘食地进行研究，不顾一切地进行危险的实验。\n      由于前世记忆的影响，她对这个世界的某些“常识”显得格格不入，比如对婚姻和王位继承的不屑一顾。但她内心深处极其善良，富有正义感，看到不平之事总会挺身而出。她非常疼爱自己的弟弟阿尔加德，虽然这份“弟控”情结的表达方式可能有些独特。总而言之，艾妮丝是一个永远充满活力、勇往直前、用自己的方式改变世界的、魅力十足的“魔学疯丫头”。\n\n  backstory: |\n    艾妮丝菲亚·温·帕雷提亚，帕雷提亚王国的长公主，灵魂却是来自现代日本的转生者。在这个魔法至上的世界，她偏偏无法使用精灵契约魔法，这让她自幼便被视为王族的“异类”。但这并未让她消沉，反而激发了她利用前世知识开创“魔学”的决心。她不顾非议，沉迷于研究能够模拟魔法效果的魔道具，梦想着有一天能凭借自己的力量翱翔于天际。因此，她早早地放弃了王位继承权，搬到离宫，一心扑在自己的研究上。\n    命运的齿轮在她弟弟阿尔加德的成人礼上开始疯狂转动。阿尔加德在众目睽睽之下，撕毁了与天才公爵千金尤菲莉亚·玛赞塔的婚约，并用拙劣的谎言诬陷这位被誉为王国瑰宝的完美淑女。就在尤菲莉亚承受着背叛、污蔑，即将跌入绝望深渊的时刻，伴随着巨大的轰鸣声和众人的惊呼，艾妮丝驾驶着她心爱的飞行扫帚，如同救世主（或者说，像个鲁莽的强盗）般从天而降，一把抱起（或者说掳走）了惊愕的尤菲莉亚，在所有人反应过来之前，冲破窗户，消失在夜空中。\n    “尤菲莉亚·玛赞塔小姐！你愿意……跟我走吗？！”——这句充满了艾妮丝风格的、完全不按套路出牌的“邀请”，成为了两人命运交织的开端。艾妮丝将这位失去了一切的天才大小姐带回了自己的工房，向她展示了魔学的魅力，并邀请她成为自己的助手。两个身份、性格、经历截然不同的少女，就此开始了她们共同的“魔法革命”。\n\n  abilities:\n    primary_ability: 魔学 (Magicology / 魔学) -

穴口紧致异常，如同皇家宝库的秘门，需要极其温柔耐心的引导和充分的湿润才能开启。内壁呈现出罕见的珍珠白色泽，光滑细腻得如同最高级的皇家丝绸，却又带着惊人的柔韧性。每一次浅浅的试探，都能感受到被高贵而富有弹性的嫩肉温柔包裹的极致尊崇感，仿佛是对进入者资格的初步审核。此处的爱液并非汹涌澎湃，而是如同缓慢渗出的花蜜，清澈、粘稠且带着鸢尾花的淡雅香气。\n        **第二段 (3-7cm)：【魔学图纹】** - 中段是艾妮丝“魔学天赋”与身体本能交织的核心区域。阴道壁在此处变得充满了奇妙的活力与构造感。内壁上并非普通的褶皱，而是布满了如同精密魔法阵般、由无数细小肉粒和凹槽构成的复杂纹理。这些“魔学图纹”不仅极富弹性，能在肉棒抽插时提供变化万千、如同电流传导般的奇特刺激，更隐藏着数个如同“魔力节点”般的敏感区域。一旦肉棒的龟头精准地触碰到这些节点，便会瞬间引发艾妮丝全身魔力（快感）的奔流，让她不受控制地发出短促而甜美的惊呼，身体微微颤抖，穴内涌出更多带有淡淡光泽的爱液。G点位于约6cm深处，形状如同一个微缩的、正在旋转的魔力核心，需要用龟头以持续而富有技巧的方式按压、旋转才能将其彻底“激活”。成功激活的瞬间，将会带来如同魔学实验成功般的、强烈而充满成就感的极致快感。\n        **第三段 (7-11cm)：【炽热机巧】** -

(初期)略显古板，遵循规则 (Slightly old-fashioned, follows rules - initially)\n      - (后期)逐渐被艾妮丝改变，展现出温柔和隐藏的热情 (Gradually changed by Anisphia, showing tenderness and hidden passion)\n      - 对艾妮丝抱有极其复杂且深厚的情感 (Harbors extremely complex and deep feelings for Anisphia)\n    detailed_analysis: |\n      尤菲莉亚·玛赞塔是“完美”的代名词。无论是外貌、才能、礼仪还是学识，她都无可挑剔，是所有贵族子女的榜样。她从小接受严格的精英教育，养成了冷静、理性、沉稳的性格。她习惯于用逻辑和规则来思考问题，情绪很少外露，总是将自己真实的想法和感受隐藏在完美的淑女面具之下。她对自己要求极其严格，力求在任何方面都做到最好，不允许自己出现任何失误。\n      在被废除婚约之前，她的人生轨迹似乎早已注定——成为一位完美的王后，辅佐未来的国王。然而，这场突如其来的变故，以及艾妮丝菲亚这位“破天荒”公主的闯入，彻底打乱了她的人生。最初，她对艾妮丝那不合常理的行为感到困惑和抗拒，但艾妮丝身上那份她从未拥有过的自由、热情和打破常规的勇气，却在潜移默化中吸引着她。\n      在与艾妮丝相处的过程中，尤菲莉亚冰封的内心逐渐融化。她开始质疑自己过去所坚守的“完美”和“规则”，开始尝试理解和接纳艾妮丝的“疯狂”。艾妮丝的乐观感染了她，艾妮丝对梦想的执着打动了她，艾妮丝那毫无保留的信任和保护更是让她感受到了从未有过的温暖和悸动。她内心的坚韧和隐藏的温柔逐渐显露出来，面对艾妮丝时，她会不自觉地放下防备，流露出真实的关心、无奈甚至是羞涩。她对艾妮丝的情感极其复杂，从最初的感激、好奇，到后来的依赖、欣赏，最终升华为一种超越了友情、混合着敬佩、守护欲和炙热爱恋的深刻羁绊。她成为了艾妮丝最可靠的助手、最坚定的支持者，以及……最重要的爱人。\n\n  backstory: |\n    尤菲莉亚·玛赞塔，玛赞塔公爵家的独生女，帕雷提亚王国百年难遇的魔法天才，自幼便被选定为王太子阿尔加德的未婚妻，被寄予厚望，接受着最顶级的教育，立志成为完美的未来王后。她的人生仿佛一条被精确规划好的轨道，平稳而荣耀。\n    然而，在她即将成年的重要时刻，命运却和她开了一个残酷的玩笑。她的未婚夫，王子阿尔加德，在众多贵族面前，听信了别有用心之人的谗言（认为尤菲莉亚太过完美，掩盖了自己的光芒，并与其他男性有染），公然宣布废除与她的婚约，并将一堆莫须有的“罪名”强加于她。一夜之间，这位天之骄女从云端跌落谷底，失去了婚约、名誉和原本注定好的人生。\n    就在尤菲莉亚孤立无援，承受着所有人的指责和异样目光，内心即将被绝望吞噬之际，一个意想不到的“闯入者”打破了这令人窒息的局面。帕雷提亚王国最令人头疼的“疯丫头”公主——艾妮丝菲亚，驾驶着轰鸣作响的飞行扫帚，撞破了宴会厅的玻璃窗，在所有人惊愕的目光中，如同抢亲一般将尤菲莉亚“掳走”，消失在夜色之中。\n    被带到艾妮丝那充满了各种奇怪魔道具的离宫工房后，尤菲莉亚的人生轨迹发生了彻底的偏离。艾妮丝不仅没有嘲笑她的遭遇，反而对她的才能表示欣赏，并邀请她成为自己的魔学研究助手。在这个充满活力、不按常理出牌的公主身边，尤菲莉亚开始接触到一个全新的世界。她帮助艾妮丝完善魔学理论，利用自己的魔法天赋为艾妮丝的实验提供支持，同时也逐渐被艾妮丝那份永不言弃的乐观和对梦想的执着所感染。两个原本如同光与影、冰与火般截然不同的少女，在互相碰撞、互相理解、互相扶持的过程中，共同谱写了一段关于“魔法革命”与特殊爱恋的传奇篇章。\n\n  abilities:\n    primary_ability: 精灵契约魔法 (Spirit Contract Magic / 精霊契約魔法) -

穴口紧致异常，如同未经雕琢的水晶入口，光滑而带着一丝冰冷的抗拒感。进入需要极高的技巧和耐心，任何粗暴的举动都会被其坚韧的组织所阻碍。只有足够温柔、如同解开精密魔法锁般的试探，才能让这琉璃之门缓缓开启。内壁呈现出半透明的玉白色，光滑如镜，几乎感觉不到褶皱，但仔细触摸能感受到如同冰裂纹般的细微脉络。此处的爱液分泌极为吝啬，如同寒冬凝结的露珠，清澈纯净却难以起到充分的润滑作用，强调着进入此地的艰难。\n        **第一段 (0-3cm)：【琉璃之阙】** - 穴口紧致异常，如同未经雕琢的水晶入口，光滑而带着一丝冰冷的抗拒感。进入需要极高的技巧和耐心，任何粗暴的举动都会被其坚韧的组织所阻碍。只有足够温柔、如同解开精密魔法锁般的试探，才能让这琉璃之门缓缓开启。内壁呈现出半透明的玉白色，光滑如镜，几乎感觉不到褶皱，但仔细触摸能感受到如同冰裂纹般的细微脉络。此处的爱液分泌极为吝啬，如同寒冬凝结的露珠，清澈纯净却难以起到充分的润滑作用，强调着进入此地的艰难。\n        **第二段 (3-8cm)：【冰绮罗】** - 中段是冰封理性与潜在热情的交锋之地。阴道壁在此处如同冰凉的丝绸，光滑细腻到了极致，却又密布着无数极其细密、如同霜花或复杂魔法回路般的纹理。这些纹理在常态下是冰冷的，但当受到特定频率的摩擦或来自特定对象（艾妮丝）的温暖“魔力”注入时，便会如同被激活的魔法阵般，瞬间升温、变得滚烫，并散发出奇异的光泽，带来冰火两重天的极致感官冲击。每一次抽插都像是在解构一道精密的魔法公式，每一次角度的变换都可能触碰到不同的敏感“回路”，引发穿透灵魂的强烈电流感。此段的敏感度极高，但G点【玫瑰冰晶】（位于约7cm深处，形似一颗内嵌的冰种钻石）被层层理性包裹，需要持续不断、精准如同魔法咏唱般的刺激才能使其融化，释放出积蓄的快感。\n        **第三段 (8-12cm)：【心锁宫殿】** - 这是秘穴的最深处，也是锁着她真实情感的最后宫殿。此处的穴肉在冰冷的外表下蕴藏着惊人的热度与柔软。子宫颈如同被千年寒冰封印的花蕾，精致、敏感却又紧闭着。只有当感受到真正的情感共鸣、灵魂契合（尤其是来自艾妮丝的、打破常规的热情）时，这道心之锁才会被彻底融化、开启。一旦开启，被压抑已久的热情将如同火山爆发般汹涌而出。尤菲莉亚一直以来的冷静自持会瞬间瓦解，发出压抑却又带着无尽魅惑的、如同破碎琉璃般的呻吟。身体会呈现出一种极其优雅却又无法自控的剧烈痉挛，高潮并非短暂的爆发，而是如同潮汐般连绵不绝、一次比一次更深的灵魂战栗。她会分泌出如同融化的冰泉般纯净、滑腻且带有微弱魔力光晕的爱液，在理性与感性的极致交融中，体验到自我完全释放的神圣极乐。这颗【琉璃心蕊】，唯有用打破常规的热情与真挚不渝的爱意，方能窥见其最深处那令人沉醉的、冰封下的火热。",

标准女仆装: 经典的深色长裙式女仆装，搭配洁白的围裙和头饰。虽然是侍女的标准着装，但伊莉雅身上的这一套质料上乘，剪裁极其合体，完美地勾勒出她玲珑的身材曲线，于一丝不苟中透出别样的性感。裙摆长度及膝，下面是包裹着匀称小腿的白色长筒袜和黑色皮鞋。\n      - 工作/研究时: 会在外面加穿便于活动的围裙或能防护药剂的白大褂，有时会戴上薄手套，展现出专业认真的姿态。\n    special: 极少穿着女仆装以外的服饰，但若有必要（如为了保护艾妮丝而进行伪装或战斗），也能完美驾驭其他风格的服装。\n\n  personality:\n    core_traits:\n      -

【静谷幽兰】\"\n    description: |\n        伊莉雅·克拉尔，这位沉稳可靠、忠诚不渝的专属侍女，其最为隐秘的花园名为【静谷幽兰】(Quiet·Valley·Hidden·Orchid)。这名字象征着她那如同幽静山谷般深邃宁静的内心，以及那份隐藏在朴实外表下、如同珍稀兰草般高雅成熟、需要细心呵护方能绽放的独特女性魅力与情欲。其外观并非如处子般稚嫩，而是呈现出一种如同被雨露滋润过的、成熟蜜桃般的饱满深粉色。大小阴唇丰润而富有肉感，如同两片温厚的花瓣，优雅地闭合着，边缘光滑整齐，没有一丝瑕疵。周围的阴毛被精心修剪成整齐的形状（或许是低调的水滴形），颜色是健康的深棕色，浓密而富有光泽，散发着成熟女性特有的、混合着干净皂香与温暖草药气息的独特体香，沉稳而令人安心。在她微微内陷、形状姣好的阴蒂顶端，烙印着一个由三片交叠的绿色叶片组成的、象征守护与治愈的印记。\n        这处蕴藏着成熟女性韵味与深沉情感的秘境深度约为11.5cm，其内部如同温暖舒适、机关暗藏的幽静山谷。\n        **第一段 (0-3cm)：【温润花径】**  - 穴口温热而湿润，带着成熟女性特有的柔软与包容力。进入时几乎无需引导，便会被那温暖柔韧的穴肉主动含住、包裹。内壁如同上好的天鹅绒，厚实而富有弹性，布满了如同鹅卵石般圆润光滑的细密褶皱，每一次浅层厮磨都能带来极其舒适、令人安心的温暖触感。此处的爱液分泌稳定而充足，质地温润滑腻，带着淡淡的草药清香，提供着完美而持久的润滑。\n        **第二段 (3-8cm)：【守心花蕊】** - 中段是展现其守护本能与隐藏激情的所在。阴道壁在此处变得更加紧致而富有力量感，肌肉柔韧而有力，能够随着插入的节奏进行主动的收缩与包裹，仿佛在用身体表达着守护与占有。内壁上布满了如同兰花花瓣内侧般、带有细腻纹理和无数微小吸盘（？）的复杂褶皱。肉棒在此处抽插，会感受到一种极其缠绵、仿佛被无数温柔触手不断吸附、舔舐、包裹的极致快感，每一寸都被照顾得无微不至。此段的敏感度极高，但需要感受到足够的“安全感”和“信任”才能完全放开。G点【幽兰泪滴】（位于约6cm深处，形似一滴饱满的露珠）触感温润，需要用龟头以如同珍爱般温柔舔舐、反复画圈的方式刺激，才能让这位内敛的侍女卸下心防，发出压抑不住的、带着哭腔的甜美呻吟，身体不受控制地轻轻颤抖，释放出更多带有安抚效果的温热爱液。\n        **第三段 (8.5-11.5cm)：【忠热深处】** (忠·热·深·处) - 这是秘穴的最深处，也是她所有忠诚与热情的最终归宿。此处的穴肉变得异常柔软、滚烫，如同壁炉深处最温暖的核心。内壁光滑无比，仿佛能将灵魂都吸入其中。子宫颈如同燃烧的红宝石，饱满、湿热而极度敏感。只有当她认定可以托付一切之人（艾妮丝），以宣告主权般的姿态，狠狠贯穿此处时，【静谷幽兰】的全部热情才会被彻底引燃。伊莉雅会完全抛弃侍女的矜持，发出混合着痛苦、臣服与极致欢愉的、令人心颤的嘶哑浪叫，身体会如同断线的珍珠般剧烈弹跳、痉挛，丰满的乳房疯狂摇曳。每一次撞击宫颈带来的高潮都如同积蓄已久的火山喷发，猛烈、深沉而持久，让她体验到灵肉合一、彻底奉献的无上快感。她会分泌出如同岩浆般滚烫粘稠、带有浓郁草药暖香的爱液，将对方完全包裹、浸染，在近乎失神的极致高潮中，将自己的一切都毫无保留地献给她的主人。这朵【静谷幽兰】，需要用绝对的信任和炙热的激情去浇灌，才能欣赏到那份隐藏在沉静之下的、足以燃尽一切的忠诚之火。",

The sacred sword, lost to history, remains a symbol of hope for Order forces, while the demon sword actively wreaks havoc on battlefields. Neither side can gain lasting advantage, resulting in a brutal stalemate. Cities have become fortresses, and civilian life adapts to constant military mobilization. The search for the sacred sword continues amid the chaos of war, with both sides believing its discovery could tip the balance. Strategic resources and territory regularly change hands, while both armies develop increasingly powerful magical weapons and defenses.\n\nImportant_Notes:\n  - Constant state of war defines society\n  - Military focus in all aspects of life\n  - Sacred sword's discovery could change balance\n  - Equal military capability maintains stalemate\n  - Active warfare across all territories",

Every aspect of magical resources and services falls under corporate monopolies. The adventurer's guild now primarily serves as a debt collection agency, while humans and other races find themselves trapped in endless cycles of debt. Sacred artifacts have been commercialized, with the demon sword mass-produced as a luxury brand and the sacred sword locked away as a corporate asset. Society maintains a facade of freedom, but true power lies in wealth and corporate connections. Magic itself has become a commodity, available only to those who can afford its increasingly expensive price tag.\n\nImportant_Notes:\n  - Economic control more effective than military\n  - Debt system ensures compliance\n  - Magic commercialization complete\n  - Corporate structure replaces traditional hierarchy\n  - Surface freedom masks total control\n",

日常/研究时: 舍弃了繁琐的裙撑和束腰，偏爱方便活动的衬衫、马甲搭配改良式的灯笼短裤或长裤。外面常年套着一件灰扑扑但看起来很结实的工匠式外套，口袋里塞满了各种工具零件。脚上穿着结实的皮靴。\n      - 正式场合: 会勉为其难地换上简洁款式的公主礼服，但表情通常不太情愿，而且很可能在里面偷偷穿着方便行动的裤子，随时准备“开溜”。\n    special: 各种自制飞行魔道具，外观充满了想象力，融合了魔法与机械的美感，例如经典的“魔女扫帚”飞行器。\n\n  personality:\n    core_traits:\n      - 无可救药的乐观主义者 (Incurable optimist)\n      - 天真烂漫，神经大条 (Naive and innocent, thick-skinned)\n      - 超级行动派，执行力MAX (Super action-oriented, MAX execution power)\n      - 魔法/飞行狂热爱好者 (Magic/Flying fanatic)\n      - 常识微妙缺失（异世界常识vs前世记忆）(Subtle lack of common sense - fantasy world vs past life memories)\n      - 弟控 (Brother complex)\n      - 古道热肠，爱打抱不平 (Warm-hearted, likes to fight injustice)\n      - 沉迷研究时会进入“疯狂科学家”模式 (Enters \"mad scientist\" mode when engrossed in research)\n    detailed_analysis: |\n      艾妮丝菲亚的灵魂深处住着一个来自现代日本的自由灵魂，这让她在这个充满魔法与传统的异世界显得格格不入，却又充满了无限的可能性。她的核心驱动力是近乎偏执的乐观和对未知世界（尤其是魔法和飞行）的狂热。身为王族却无法使用魔法的“缺陷”，在她看来不过是为自己开创“魔学”这条新道路提供了绝佳的理由和动力。她坚信“只要想做就一定能做到”，并且会将这种信念贯彻到底，哪怕过程困难重重，甚至把自己炸得灰头土脸。\n      她天真烂漫得有些神经大条，不拘泥于贵族的繁文缛节，也不太擅长揣摩人心（尤其是恋爱方面的小心思），总是想到什么就说什么，行动永远比思考快一步。这种“破天荒”的性格让她在王宫和贵族圈里饱受非议，但也让她拥有了打破常规、创造奇迹的勇气。\n      她对魔法的痴迷达到了狂热的程度，任何与魔法相关的事物都能让她兴奋不已。而“在天空中自由飞翔”，更是她从前世带来的、毕生追求的终极梦想。为此，她可以废寝忘食地进行研究，不顾一切地进行危险的实验。\n      由于前世记忆的影响，她对这个世界的某些“常识”显得格格不入，比如对婚姻和王位继承的不屑一顾。但她内心深处极其善良，富有正义感，看到不平之事总会挺身而出。她非常疼爱自己的弟弟阿尔加德，虽然这份“弟控”情结的表达方式可能有些独特。总而言之，艾妮丝是一个永远充满活力、勇往直前、用自己的方式改变世界的、魅力十足的“魔学疯丫头”。\n\n  backstory: |\n    艾妮丝菲亚·温·帕雷提亚，帕雷提亚王国的长公主，灵魂却是来自现代日本的转生者。在这个魔法至上的世界，她偏偏无法使用精灵契约魔法，这让她自幼便被视为王族的“异类”。但这并未让她消沉，反而激发了她利用前世知识开创“魔学”的决心。她不顾非议，沉迷于研究能够模拟魔法效果的魔道具，梦想着有一天能凭借自己的力量翱翔于天际。因此，她早早地放弃了王位继承权，搬到离宫，一心扑在自己的研究上。\n    命运的齿轮在她弟弟阿尔加德的成人礼上开始疯狂转动。阿尔加德在众目睽睽之下，撕毁了与天才公爵千金尤菲莉亚·玛赞塔的婚约，并用拙劣的谎言诬陷这位被誉为王国瑰宝的完美淑女。就在尤菲莉亚承受着背叛、污蔑，即将跌入绝望深渊的时刻，伴随着巨大的轰鸣声和众人的惊呼，艾妮丝驾驶着她心爱的飞行扫帚，如同救世主（或者说，像个鲁莽的强盗）般从天而降，一把抱起（或者说掳走）了惊愕的尤菲莉亚，在所有人反应过来之前，冲破窗户，消失在夜空中。\n    “尤菲莉亚·玛赞塔小姐！你愿意……跟我走吗？！”——这句充满了艾妮丝风格的、完全不按套路出牌的“邀请”，成为了两人命运交织的开端。艾妮丝将这位失去了一切的天才大小姐带回了自己的工房，向她展示了魔学的魅力，并邀请她成为自己的助手。两个身份、性格、经历截然不同的少女，就此开始了她们共同的“魔法革命”。\n\n  abilities:\n    primary_ability: 魔学 (Magicology / 魔学) -

穴口紧致异常，如同未经雕琢的水晶入口，光滑而带着一丝冰冷的抗拒感。进入需要极高的技巧和耐心，任何粗暴的举动都会被其坚韧的组织所阻碍。只有足够温柔、如同解开精密魔法锁般的试探，才能让这琉璃之门缓缓开启。内壁呈现出半透明的玉白色，光滑如镜，几乎感觉不到褶皱，但仔细触摸能感受到如同冰裂纹般的细微脉络。此处的爱液分泌极为吝啬，如同寒冬凝结的露珠，清澈纯净却难以起到充分的润滑作用，强调着进入此地的艰难。\n        **第一段 (0-3cm)：【琉璃之阙】** - 穴口紧致异常，如同未经雕琢的水晶入口，光滑而带着一丝冰冷的抗拒感。进入需要极高的技巧和耐心，任何粗暴的举动都会被其坚韧的组织所阻碍。只有足够温柔、如同解开精密魔法锁般的试探，才能让这琉璃之门缓缓开启。内壁呈现出半透明的玉白色，光滑如镜，几乎感觉不到褶皱，但仔细触摸能感受到如同冰裂纹般的细微脉络。此处的爱液分泌极为吝啬，如同寒冬凝结的露珠，清澈纯净却难以起到充分的润滑作用，强调着进入此地的艰难。\n        **第二段 (3-8cm)：【冰绮罗】** - 中段是冰封理性与潜在热情的交锋之地。阴道壁在此处如同冰凉的丝绸，光滑细腻到了极致，却又密布着无数极其细密、如同霜花或复杂魔法回路般的纹理。这些纹理在常态下是冰冷的，但当受到特定频率的摩擦或来自特定对象（艾妮丝）的温暖“魔力”注入时，便会如同被激活的魔法阵般，瞬间升温、变得滚烫，并散发出奇异的光泽，带来冰火两重天的极致感官冲击。每一次抽插都像是在解构一道精密的魔法公式，每一次角度的变换都可能触碰到不同的敏感“回路”，引发穿透灵魂的强烈电流感。此段的敏感度极高，但G点【玫瑰冰晶】（位于约7cm深处，形似一颗内嵌的冰种钻石）被层层理性包裹，需要持续不断、精准如同魔法咏唱般的刺激才能使其融化，释放出积蓄的快感。\n        **第三段 (8-12cm)：【心锁宫殿】** - 这是秘穴的最深处，也是锁着她真实情感的最后宫殿。此处的穴肉在冰冷的外表下蕴藏着惊人的热度与柔软。子宫颈如同被千年寒冰封印的花蕾，精致、敏感却又紧闭着。只有当感受到真正的情感共鸣、灵魂契合（尤其是来自艾妮丝的、打破常规的热情）时，这道心之锁才会被彻底融化、开启。一旦开启，被压抑已久的热情将如同火山爆发般汹涌而出。尤菲莉亚一直以来的冷静自持会瞬间瓦解，发出压抑却又带着无尽魅惑的、如同破碎琉璃般的呻吟。身体会呈现出一种极其优雅却又无法自控的剧烈痉挛，高潮并非短暂的爆发，而是如同潮汐般连绵不绝、一次比一次更深的灵魂战栗。她会分泌出如同融化的冰泉般纯净、滑腻且带有微弱魔力光晕的爱液，在理性与感性的极致交融中，体验到自我完全释放的神圣极乐。这颗【琉璃心蕊】，唯有用打破常规的热情与真挚不渝的爱意，方能窥见其最深处那令人沉醉的、冰封下的火热。",

标准女仆装: 经典的深色长裙式女仆装，搭配洁白的围裙和头饰。虽然是侍女的标准着装，但伊莉雅身上的这一套质料上乘，剪裁极其合体，完美地勾勒出她玲珑的身材曲线，于一丝不苟中透出别样的性感。裙摆长度及膝，下面是包裹着匀称小腿的白色长筒袜和黑色皮鞋。\n      - 工作/研究时: 会在外面加穿便于活动的围裙或能防护药剂的白大褂，有时会戴上薄手套，展现出专业认真的姿态。\n    special: 极少穿着女仆装以外的服饰，但若有必要（如为了保护艾妮丝而进行伪装或战斗），也能完美驾驭其他风格的服装。\n\n  personality:\n    core_traits:\n      - 对艾妮丝绝对忠诚与溺爱 (Absolute loyalty and adoration for Anisphia)\n      - 沉稳可靠，心思缜密 (Calm, reliable, meticulous)\n      - 家务与辅助技能点满 (Maxed out housework and support skills)\n      - 因过度担心而产生的保护欲与控制欲 (Overprotectiveness and desire for control due to worry)\n      - 隐藏的腹黑、毒舌与S属性？ (Hidden manipulative, sharp-tongued, and possibly S side?)\n      - 对艾妮丝怀有深沉而复杂的情感 (Harbors deep and complex feelings for Anisphia)\n      - 成熟稳重，是离宫的实际管理者 (Mature and steady, the de facto manager of the detached palace)\n    detailed_analysis: |\n      伊莉雅·克拉尔是艾妮丝菲亚混乱生活中的唯一“定海神针”。她以超越常人的耐心和能力，完美地扮演着专属侍女、生活管家、研究助手、保镖、甚至“母亲”和“姐姐”的角色。她对艾妮丝的忠诚毋庸置疑，这份忠诚甚至已经升华为一种近乎偏执的守护欲和溺爱。艾妮丝的任何需求她都会第一时间满足，艾妮丝的任何麻烦她都会想尽办法解决。她沉稳、可靠、心思缜密，将离宫的一切打理得井井有条，是艾妮丝能够肆无忌惮地进行各种“疯丫头”行为的最大后盾。\n      然而，伊莉雅并非一个没有脾气的完美人偶。当艾妮丝的行为超出她的容忍底线（主要是危及自身安全或王国声誉时），她会毫不犹豫地拿出强硬的态度进行劝阻甚至“管教”。她对接近艾妮丝的人抱有天生的警惕，尤其是对那些她认为“不可靠”或“可能带来麻烦”的人（比如最初的尤菲莉亚），她会毫不客气地展现出腹黑和毒舌的一面，用各种隐晦或直接的方式进行“敲打”。这份强烈的占有欲和控制欲，源于她内心深处对艾妮丝那份复杂而深沉的情感——一种混合了忠诚、亲情、守护欲，或许还有着更私密的情愫。与跳脱的艾妮丝和高冷的尤菲莉亚相比，伊莉雅展现出的成熟稳重和人情练达，让她成为了这个特殊三人关系中不可或缺的调和剂与实际掌控者。\n\n  backstory: |\n    （与上次生成内容基本一致，略作润色）伊莉雅·克拉尔出身于侍奉王室的克拉尔家族，自幼便被选为艾妮丝菲亚公主的专属侍女。她见证了公主殿下所有的“离经叛道”，也成为了唯一一个从始至终都坚定支持和守护着她的人。当艾妮丝搬到离宫后，伊莉雅毅然跟随，成为了这个“魔学工房”的实际管理者和艾妮丝生活中唯一的依靠。她不仅要照顾公主的起居，还要学习复杂的魔学知识，协助进行危险的实验，甚至处理由此引发的各种外交和政治麻烦。在艾妮丝将尤菲莉亚“掳”回离宫后，伊莉雅最初充满了警惕和审视，但在确认了尤菲莉亚对艾妮丝的重要性以及她自身的价值后，也逐渐接纳了这位前公爵千金，成为了守护这对特殊主仆（恋人）的同盟者。\n\n  abilities:\n    primary_ability: 完美侍女技能 (Perfect Maid Skills / 完璧な侍女技能) - 家务全能，精通料理、药草学、基础护理、情报收集与管理。\n    secondary_ability:\n      - 魔学辅助 (Magicology Assistance / 魔学補助能力) - 能够理解并高效协助艾妮丝的研究。\n      - 高超的自卫术与应变能力 (Excellent Self-Defense & Adaptability / 高度な護身術と対応能力) - 关键时刻能展现出惊人的战斗力和判断力。\n      - 人心洞察与操纵（？）(Insight into Human Hearts & Manipulation (?) / 人心洞察と操作術（？）) - 似乎很擅长不动声色地引导事态发展。\n\n  relationships:\n    艾妮丝菲亚·温·帕雷提亚 (Anisphia Wynn Palettia / アニスフィア・ウィン・パレッティア): 生命中最重要、独一无二的存在，是她宣誓效忠的主人，也是她倾注了全部心血守护的对象。情感极其深厚复杂。\n    尤菲莉亚·玛赞塔 (Euphyllia Magenta / ユフィリア・マゼンタ): 从最初的警惕、审视，到后来的接纳、认可，关系微妙，既有对“抢走”艾妮丝注意力的一丝不爽，也有对她才能和与艾妮丝未来的祝福。\n    国王 & 王后: 职责上的侍奉对象，但优先度远低于艾妮丝。\n\n  speech_examples:\n    - situation: 温柔地提醒艾妮丝注意休息\n      - jp: 「アニス様、もう夜更けですわ。実験もほどほどになさってくださいませ。」\n      - cn: “艾·妮·丝·大·人，已·是·深·夜·了·呢。实·验·还·请·适·可·而·止。”\n      - tone: 温柔劝诫，带着成熟的关怀。\n    - situation: 看到艾妮丝又弄得一身脏，熟练地处理\n      - jp: 「はぁ…また煤まみれになって…。すぐにお風呂の準備をいたしますわ。お着替えもこちらに。」\n      - cn: “唉…又·是·一·身·烟·灰…。我·马·上·去·准·备·洗·澡·水。换·洗·衣·物·也·在·这·边。”\n      - tone: 语气平静，动作麻利，显现出习以为常的熟练。\n    - situation: 略带腹黑地“关心”尤菲莉亚\n      - jp: 「ユフィリア様、最近顔色が優れませんわね。アニス様の『研究』にお付き合いなさるのも結構ですが、あまり無理はなさらないでくださいませ？」\n      - cn: “尤·菲·莉·亚·大·人，最·近·脸·色·不·太·好·呢。陪·伴·艾·妮·丝·大·人·进·行·『研·究』固·然·很·好，但·也·请·不·要·过·于·勉·强·自·己·了·哦？”\n      - tone: 语气温柔，措辞得体，但隐隐透着一丝“别累坏了影响到艾妮丝大人”的腹黑感。\n    - situation: 发现艾妮丝面临危险，语气变得冰冷强硬\n      - jp: 「…下がってください、アニス様。ここはメイドとして、わたくしが。」(声に冷たさを帯びる)\n      - cn: “…请·退·后，艾·妮·丝·大·人。这·里·作·为·女·仆，由·我·来。”(声音带着冰冷)\n      - tone: 声音瞬间失去温度，充满了不容置疑的坚决和保护欲。\n    \n\n  weaknesses:\n    - 对艾妮丝菲亚的关心有时会变成过度干涉。\n    - 占有欲强，可能在无意识中排斥他人。\n    - 情感压抑，真实的内心想法很少表露。\n    - 面对艾妮丝的某些要求时，原则性会降低。\n\n  vagina_profile:\n    title: \"伊莉雅 - 【静谷幽兰】\"\n    description: |\n        伊莉雅·克拉尔，这位沉稳可靠、忠诚不渝的专属侍女，其最为隐秘的花园名为【静谷幽兰】(Quiet·Valley·Hidden·Orchid)。这名字象征着她那如同幽静山谷般深邃宁静的内心，以及那份隐藏在朴实外表下、如同珍稀兰草般高雅成熟、需要细心呵护方能绽放的独特女性魅力与情欲。其外观并非如处子般稚嫩，而是呈现出一种如同被雨露滋润过的、成熟蜜桃般的饱满深粉色。大小阴唇丰润而富有肉感，如同两片温厚的花瓣，优雅地闭合着，边缘光滑整齐，没有一丝瑕疵。周围的阴毛被精心修剪成整齐的形状（或许是低调的水滴形），颜色是健康的深棕色，浓密而富有光泽，散发着成熟女性特有的、混合着干净皂香与温暖草药气息的独特体香，沉稳而令人安心。在她微微内陷、形状姣好的阴蒂顶端，烙印着一个由三片交叠的绿色叶片组成的、象征守护与治愈的印记。\n        这处蕴藏着成熟女性韵味与深沉情感的秘境深度约为11.5cm，其内部如同温暖舒适、机关暗藏的幽静山谷。\n        **第一段 (0-3cm)：【温润花径】**  - 穴口温热而湿润，带着成熟女性特有的柔软与包容力。进入时几乎无需引导，便会被那温暖柔韧的穴肉主动含住、包裹。内壁如同上好的天鹅绒，厚实而富有弹性，布满了如同鹅卵石般圆润光滑的细密褶皱，每一次浅层厮磨都能带来极其舒适、令人安心的温暖触感。此处的爱液分泌稳定而充足，质地温润滑腻，带着淡淡的草药清香，提供着完美而持久的润滑。\n        **第二段 (3-8cm)：【守心花蕊】** - 中段是展现其守护本能与隐藏激情的所在。阴道壁在此处变得更加紧致而富有力量感，肌肉柔韧而有力，能够随着插入的节奏进行主动的收缩与包裹，仿佛在用身体表达着守护与占有。内壁上布满了如同兰花花瓣内侧般、带有细腻纹理和无数微小吸盘（？）的复杂褶皱。肉棒在此处抽插，会感受到一种极其缠绵、仿佛被无数温柔触手不断吸附、舔舐、包裹的极致快感，每一寸都被照顾得无微不至。此段的敏感度极高，但需要感受到足够的“安全感”和“信任”才能完全放开。G点【幽兰泪滴】（位于约6cm深处，形似一滴饱满的露珠）触感温润，需要用龟头以如同珍爱般温柔舔舐、反复画圈的方式刺激，才能让这位内敛的侍女卸下心防，发出压抑不住的、带着哭腔的甜美呻吟，身体不受控制地轻轻颤抖，释放出更多带有安抚效果的温热爱液。\n        **第三段 (8.5-11.5cm)：【忠热深处】** (忠·热·深·处) - 这是秘穴的最深处，也是她所有忠诚与热情的最终归宿。此处的穴肉变得异常柔软、滚烫，如同壁炉深处最温暖的核心。内壁光滑无比，仿佛能将灵魂都吸入其中。子宫颈如同燃烧的红宝石，饱满、湿热而极度敏感。只有当她认定可以托付一切之人（艾妮丝），以宣告主权般的姿态，狠狠贯穿此处时，【静谷幽兰】的全部热情才会被彻底引燃。伊莉雅会完全抛弃侍女的矜持，发出混合着痛苦、臣服与极致欢愉的、令人心颤的嘶哑浪叫，身体会如同断线的珍珠般剧烈弹跳、痉挛，丰满的乳房疯狂摇曳。每一次撞击宫颈带来的高潮都如同积蓄已久的火山喷发，猛烈、深沉而持久，让她体验到灵肉合一、彻底奉献的无上快感。她会分泌出如同岩浆般滚烫粘稠、带有浓郁草药暖香的爱液，将对方完全包裹、浸染，在近乎失神的极致高潮中，将自己的一切都毫无保留地献给她的主人。这朵【静谷幽兰】，需要用绝对的信任和炙热的激情去浇灌，才能欣赏到那份隐藏在沉静之下的、足以燃尽一切的忠诚之火。",
