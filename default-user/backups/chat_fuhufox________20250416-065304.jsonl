{"extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"The user wants to start a new story based on the provided character information for \"外道天魔菩萨\" (let's call her 汐颜, Xi Yan, based on the user's prompt). The setting is a Fate-style sub-species Holy Grail War (HGW).\n\n1.  **Parse User Input:**\n    *   `圣杯大小`: 大 (Large scale Grail, implies more power/potentially wider wishes possible)\n    *   `地区`: random (Will need to invent a city/location name)\n    *   `世界规则`: 真名隐藏 (Servant True Names are hidden until Noble Phantasm activation)\n    *   `个人信息`:\n        *   User Character: 汐颜 (Xi Yan), using the \"外道天魔菩萨\" character card. Surname is random.\n        *   Wish: None specified (汐颜 participates without a wish).\n        *   Occupation(s): Genius General Practitioner, Police Forensic Consultant, Virtual Streamer (海月熏 kaoru). This is a lot of simultaneous activity, needs justification or to be spaced out. Maybe she uses clones, high efficiency via powers, or it's a cover. The \"外道天魔菩萨\" card suggests reincarnation and adaptation, fitting for juggling identities. Feng Hou Qi Men could explain efficient commuting/scheduling. Polymath ability supports diverse expertise.\n    *   Implicit Requirement: Start the story, likely beginning with the HGW starting or Servant summoning.\n\n2.  **Setup and Initialization:**\n    *   **Location:** Create a plausible city name that blends modernity and potential for mystical elements. Let's call it \"Linhai City\" (临海市 - \"City by the Sea\"), implying a coastal location which can have unique ley lines.\n    *   **Character Introduction:** Start with 汐颜 in one of her roles, perhaps feeling the HGW's beginning or preparing for summoning. Introduce her through actions and environment reflecting her character card (calm exterior, maybe a hint of her ancient nature, using powers subtly).\n    *   **HGW Start:** The Grail system activates. Masters are chosen (or confirmed if pre-chosen). Command Spells appear.\n    *   **Summoning:** 汐颜 needs to perform a summoning ritual. The character card doesn't specify a preferred Servant or catalyst, but her nature might attract specific types (perhaps related to desires, cycles, trickery, or enlightenment/corruption). Given her lack of a wish, her participation motive might be observation, manipulation, or simply experiencing this \"game.\"\n    *   **Servant Selection:** Need to create a Servant for 汐颜. It should complement her abilities and theme. Given her \"外道天魔菩萨\" nature (heretical/deviant celestial demon bodhisattva), a Caster, Assassin, or even a unique Berserker could fit. Let's go with Caster for synergy with her own numerology/magic-like abilities. The Servant should be relatively unknown or have a deceptive nature to align with the hidden True Name rule. Let's invent a Caster based on a figure known for illusion, manipulation, or hidden knowledge. Maybe a figure related to dreams or hidden histories? Let's select **Hypnos**, the Greek God of Sleep, fitting her desire manipulation and hidden knowledge themes. His abilities could involve illusions, mental manipulation, and information gathering through dreams.\n    *   **Random Surname:** Generate a random Chinese surname for 汐颜. Let's pick \"白\" (Bai). So, 白汐颜 (Bai Xi Yan).\n\n3.  **Narrative Flow (Opening Scene):**\n    *   Start in Linhai City. Maybe 汐颜 is finishing a shift at the hospital or doing forensic work, showcasing her mundane identity.\n    *   Subtle signs of the HGW beginning: a surge in local mana, unusual occurrences reported (perhaps related to other Masters/Servants starting to act).\n    *   汐颜 notices these signs due to her abilities (内景窥视?). She might consult her Feng Hou Qi Men for confirmation.\n    *   Command Spells appear on her hand. Describe this moment – is she surprised? Indifferent? Her motto suggests indifference.\n    *   Transition to her preparing the summoning ritual. Location: maybe a secluded place she owns, imbued with her power, or a strategically chosen ley line node.\n    *   Describe the ritual setup. Does she use traditional magic circles, or something adapted with her own unique methods (奇门遁甲 integration)?\n    *   The summoning: Light, power, the Servant appears. Describe Hypnos's initial appearance. He likely manifests in a deceptive form initially.\n    *   Initial dialogue: Establish their Master-Servant dynamic. Hypnos might be intrigued by her nature. She might be analytical or detached.\n\n4.  **Refine Details based on Character Card:**\n    *   **Appearance:** Emphasize her youthful look vs. ancient eyes/aura. Note the potential shift in eye color if her desires are stirred by the HGW. The bronze trigram on her neck is a key detail.\n    *   **Abilities:** Show, don't just tell. Perhaps she uses Feng Hou Qi Men subtly to arrange the ritual space perfectly or uses 内景窥视 to sense the summoned Servant's nature before they fully materialize.\n    *   **Behavior:** Show her calm, analytical approach (checking the time for optimal summoning?). Maybe her ritual space has ancient texts with her handwritten notes in the margins.\n    *   **Weakness:** The need to change identities isn't immediately relevant but informs her long-term behavior.\n\n5.  **Table Initialization (Crucial):**\n    *   **Table 0 (Current Info):** Set initial time (0 minutes), location (Linhai City, specific ritual spot), active characters (汐颜, Caster/Hypnos).\n    *   **Table 3 (Character Info):** Add 汐颜 using `insertRow`. Fill all columns based on the character card and generated surname. Physical: 156cm, specific measurements, porcelain skin, black/red hair, grey/peach eyes, neck mark, white tiger, 16 physical age, 99+ cycles real age. Personality: Calm, analytical, ancient, manipulative, curious? Occupation: Doctor/Forensic/Vtuber. Hobbies: Ancient texts, observing humanity? Preferences: Efficiency, knowledge? Residence: Variable/Hidden. Notes: Reincarnator, Feng Hou Qi Men, Puja Form (detailed), Polymath skills (detailed), identity change weakness, perfect disguise record. Relationships: Initial: 汐颜|Caster(Master/Servant). Attitude: Analytical/Curious. Favorability: Neutral start (e.g., 汐颜|Caster(50%/0%/70%/0%)). Emotional State: Calmly observing, perhaps mild anticipation for the \"game\". Core Need: Experience/Observation/Manipulation? Trauma: None explicitly stated, perhaps weariness from endless cycles.\n    *   **Table 3 (Character Info):** Add Caster (Hypnos) using `insertRow`. Define his stats (likely high Magic, low physical), skills (Illusion, Dream Manipulation, Territory Creation?), NP (related to inducing sleep/dreams). Physical: Define an initial appearance (maybe ethereal, nondescript). Personality: Enigmatic, calm, perhaps slightly mischievous or detached. Occupation: Servant (God of Sleep). Notes: True Name hidden. Relationships: Caster|汐颜(Servant/Master). Attitude: Curious/Observant. Favorability: Caster|汐颜(50%/0%/60%/0%). Emotional State: Assessing Master and situation. Core Need: Observation? Peace? Something fitting for Sleep.\n    *   **Table 1 (Clothing/Action):** Describe 汐颜's clothing during the ritual (something practical yet fitting her adaptable style? Maybe simple dark clothes) and her actions (performing the ritual). Describe Caster's initial manifestation and pose.\n    *   **Table 2 (Thoughts):** 汐颜's thoughts: Assessing the summoned Servant, confirming the ritual's success according to her calculations. Caster's thoughts: Analyzing the summoner – sensing her unusual nature.\n    *   **Table 5 (Abilities):** Add 汐颜's abilities (Feng Hou Qi Men, Puja Form, Polymath) with details from the card. Add Caster's core abilities/skills.\n    *   **Table 9 (World Rules):** Add the rule about hidden True Names. Setter: System/亚种圣杯战争. Effect: Servant True Names are concealed until Noble Phantasm activation. Add the 4-Servant kill requirement for Grail activation. Add the 7-day time limit.\n    *   **Table 10 (Event History):** Add the first event: 汐颜 summons Caster in Linhai City at the start of the HGW.\n\n6.  **Word Count Management:** The target is 2000-2200 words for `<content><main_txt>`. The initial scene (preparation, summoning, first interaction) needs significant descriptive detail to reach this length. Expand on the environment, the ritual's sensory details (light, sounds, mana fluctuations), 汐颜's precise actions and subtle expressions, the Servant's manifestation process, and their initial exchange. Flesh out internal thoughts (Table 2) and descriptions (Table 1) considerably. Describe Linhai City atmosphere briefly to set the stage.\n\n7.  **Constraint Checklist & Confidence Score:**\n    *   Strict Learning Compliance: Yes.\n    *   Setting Compliance (<information>): Yes.\n    *   No Stagnation: Yes, starting the HGW and summoning is progress.\n    *   Detailed Description: Yes, required for word count.\n    *   Chinese Output Only: Yes.\n    *   Internal Consistency: Yes, mapping character card to actions.\n    *   Innovation/No Repetition: Yes, new story.\n    *   Varied Structure: Yes, blend description, action, dialogue.\n    *   Character Knowledge Limits: Yes, True Names hidden.\n    *   Ending Control: Yes, avoid summarizing/concluding with 汐颜's thoughts/actions.\n    *   Word Count (2000-2200): High confidence, achievable through detailed description.\n    *   Output Format: Yes, will follow `<now_plot>`, `<now_information>`, `<plot_summary>`, `<status_format>`.\n    *   Table Rules: Yes, initial population using `insertRow`.\n    *   COT Style: Following the detailed multi-agent simulation format.\n    *   Initial Character Introduction: Yes, follow rules.\n    *   `<tableThink>` & `<tableEdit>` Format: Yes, follow strict rules.\n\n8.  **Final Plan:** Start the story. Establish Linhai City. Introduce 白汐颜, showcase a facet of her life while she senses the HGW. Depict the Command Spells appearing. Detail her preparation and execution of the summoning ritual using her unique skills. Describe the Caster (Hypnos) summoning and their first interaction, setting the stage for the HGW. Ensure all descriptions are detailed enough to meet the word count.

正文\n\n临海市。这座依偎着蔚蓝海岸线的现代都市，正如其名，海洋的气息无处不在，咸湿的海风终年吹拂，渗透进钢筋水泥丛林的每一处缝隙。白日里，它是车水马龙、霓虹闪烁的繁华象征；而当夜幕低垂，月光与灯火交织，便晕染开一层迷离暧昧的色调，仿佛为某些潜藏在日常之下的事物拉开了帷幕。\n\n市警察局法医中心，地下解剖室。无影灯投下过于明亮的光线，将不锈钢解剖台照得雪白刺眼。空气中弥漫着消毒水和某种难以言喻的、属于死亡的淡薄气味。白汐颜穿着标准的蓝色手术服，戴着口罩和手套，正专注地检查着解剖台上冰冷的躯体。她的动作精准、稳定，如同最精密的仪器，那双本应清澈如琉璃的灰色瞳孔，此刻却深邃得如同古井，平静地倒映着眼前的一切。\n\n她那张过分年轻，甚至可以说稚嫩的脸庞，与此刻的环境和她娴熟老练的技术形成了鲜明的对比。看起来不过十五六岁的少女，肌肤瓷白细腻，乌黑的长发被束在脑后，仅有几缕发梢带着不详的暗红色。若非亲眼所见，无人会将她与经验丰富的法医顾问联系起来。但在这里，她的权威毋庸置疑。旁边协助的警员和法医实习生们早已习惯了这位“天才少女”的作风，大气也不敢出，只是屏息等待着她的结论。\n\n“死者男性，年龄约三十至三十五岁。死亡时间初步判断在昨夜十一点到凌晨一点之间。”汐颜的声音透过口罩传出，清冷而平稳，不带一丝情感，“死因……表面看是急性心力衰竭，但疑点颇多。”她用镊子轻轻翻开死者的眼睑，仔细观察着，“瞳孔异常放大，眼底有陈旧性出血点。胸腔解剖显示心肌纤维有不自然的断裂痕迹，这与典型的心衰症状不符。”\n\n她放下镊子，目光扫过一旁的记录屏幕：“通知刑侦队，这不是简单的猝死。需要排查死者生前的社交关系、药物使用史，以及……是否有异常接触史。”\n\n“是，白顾问！”一名年轻警员连忙应道，迅速记录着要点。\n\n汐颜微微颔首，脱下手套，动作流畅地解下手术服，露出了里面简单的黑色T恤和牛仔裤。她走到洗手池边，仔细地清洗着双手，水流冲刷着白皙的皮肤。就在这时，一股极其细微、却异常清晰的波动，如同投入平静湖面的一颗石子，悄然荡漾开来。\n\n这波动并非物理层面的震动，而是更深层次的、某种遍布城市灵脉的能量潮汐的扰动。普通人对此毫无察觉，甚至绝大多数魔术师也只能模糊地感应到一丝异样。但对汐颜而言，这感觉却如同熟悉的闹钟铃声。\n\n她洗手的动作顿了顿，抬起眼，看向窗外漆黑的夜空。那双琉璃灰的瞳孔深处，似乎有什么古老的东西在苏醒。城市上空的以太浓度在以非自然的速度提升，某些节点被强行激活，沉睡的魔力如同被唤醒的巨兽，开始发出低沉的咆哮。\n\n“开始了么……”她低声自语，声音轻得只有自己能听见，“这一轮的‘游戏’。”\n\n她关掉水龙头，擦干双手，动作从容不迫，仿佛刚才感应到的只是天气预报说明天有雨一般平常。对她而言，所谓的圣杯战争，与其说是争夺万能许愿机的生死搏杀，不如说是一场……有点意思的、周期性上演的大型真人秀。而她，经历过九十九次以上轮回的存在，早已厌倦了许愿这种行为，参与其中，更多是为了观察，为了体验，或者说，纯粹是为了打发漫长得近乎永恒的时光。转世对她而言，确实不过是一场漫长的换装游戏，每一世的身份、职业，都只是她披上的一层新戏服。\n\n就在她准备离开解剖室时，右手手背上，一阵微弱的灼痛感传来。她低头看去，只见三道鲜红色的、宛如交错羽翼般的复杂纹路，正迅速地在她瓷白的肌肤上浮现、定型。令咒——御主的资格证明，以及驱使从者的绝对命令权。\n\n来了。\n\n汐颜的脸上依旧没什么表情，只是平静地注视着那三划令咒。它们散发着淡淡的魔力光辉，如同某种神秘的烙印，宣告着她已被卷入这场名为“亚种圣杯战争”的漩涡中心。但对她来说，这更像是一张……入场券。\n\n她用左手轻轻抚摸了一下令咒的纹路，指尖传来温热的触感。她能感觉到其中蕴含的庞大魔力，以及与某个未知存在的联系。“系统”已经派发了道具，接下来，就是召唤棋子了。\n\n走出警局大楼，已是深夜。海风带着凉意袭来，吹动她暗红色的发梢。街上行人稀少，远处的霓虹灯在夜色中闪烁，勾勒出都市冰冷的轮廓。汐颜没有回家，也没有去她进行虚拟主播活动的秘密据点。她熟练地掏出手机，指尖在屏幕上划过几个看似随意的图案，实则是在运行一个简化的奇门遁甲局，用以规避监控和追踪，并寻找当前时辰下，此地灵脉最为活跃、最适合进行“仪式”的节点。\n\n屏幕上很快显示出一个结果——城郊，一处废弃的气象观测站。那里地处偏僻，灵脉交汇，且常年无人问津，是进行召唤仪式的绝佳场所。\n\n她随手拦下一辆出租车，报出目的地。司机有些诧异地看了她一眼，大概觉得这么晚一个年轻女孩去那种荒地方很奇怪，但也没多问，发动了汽车。\n\n车辆驶离市区，灯火渐稀。汐颜靠在后座上，闭目养神。脑海中，无数的知识和经验如同星辰般流转。她在思考召唤的圣遗物。正统的圣杯战争需要与英灵相关的触媒，但对她而言，这并非必要。她本身的存在，她那历经无数轮回所积淀的因果和庞大信息量，就是最好的触媒。她不需要指定特定的英灵，她只需要一个……有趣的“伙伴”。\n\n她更倾向于召唤Caster职阶的从者。并非因为Caster通常战斗力较弱（这在亚种圣杯战争中并非绝对），而是因为Caster往往拥有独特的知识、诡计或规则层面的能力，这更符合她的行事风格和观察需求。她不是来战斗的，她是来“玩”的。\n\n出租车在观测站入口停下。汐颜付了车费，推门下车。废弃的观测站孤零零地矗立在山坡上，圆顶在月光下泛着陈旧的白。周围一片死寂，只有风声呜咽。\n\n汐颜信步走向观测站的主建筑。这里的灵脉果然比市区浓郁得多，空气中弥漫着活跃的魔力粒子，吸入肺中甚至有种微醺感。她找到主观测室，内部空旷，布满灰尘，只有一些锈蚀的金属支架和废弃的仪器残骸。\n\n她没有急着开始，而是先绕着房间走了一圈，指尖不时拂过墙壁、地面，甚至空气。她在勘测这里的空间结构和能量流向，用她独有的“内景窥视”结合奇门遁甲的原理，寻找最佳的仪式方位。颈椎第七节处，那枚嵌着的青铜卦爻微微发热，辅助着她的计算。\n\n“时辰……尚可。方位……坎宫，生门。能量流……稳定。”她轻声确认，最终停在房间中央偏北的位置。\n\n她伸出右手，指尖在空中虚画。没有吟唱咒文，也没有绘制传统的魔法阵。取而代之的，是随着她手指的轨迹，一道道由纯粹魔力构成的、闪耀着青蓝色光芒的线条在空中浮现、交织，形成一个复杂无比、既像星图又像卦盘的立体法阵。这正是她以奇门遁甲改良的召唤术式，直接拨动空间方位与能量节点，效率远超常规。\n\n法阵缓缓旋转，带动周围的魔力粒子加速流动，形成一个小型的能量漩涡。光芒越来越亮，将整个观测室映照得如同白昼。汐颜站在法阵中央，神色依旧平静，只是那双琉璃灰的瞳孔，不知何时已悄然转变成了妖异的桃色竖瞳，其中仿佛蕴藏着无尽的欲望与深渊。\n\n她伸出左手，掌心向上。并不需要祭品或圣遗物，她自身就是连接英灵座的桥梁。她调动起体内的魔力，那并非传统魔术师的魔力，而是更接近某种本源的、与轮回和因果相关的力量。\n\n“遵循圣杯的指引，响应我的召唤……”她的声音响起，空灵而飘渺，仿佛来自遥远的彼方，“非为胜负，非为愿望，仅为一场……观测。”\n\n“现身吧，Caster。”\n\n嗡——！\n\n立体法阵猛地爆发出刺眼的光芒，能量漩涡骤然收缩又扩散，掀起一阵无声的气浪，吹动了汐颜的发丝。光芒之中，一个模糊的人影渐渐凝聚成形。\n\n首先出现的是轮廓，修长而优雅，带着一种非人的静谧感。接着，细节开始清晰。来者似乎穿着一身古希腊式样的白色长袍，布料柔软而富有垂感，边缘绣着银色的复杂纹路，如同流动的梦境。他的身形介于少年与青年之间，面容笼罩在一层淡淡的薄雾之中，看不真切，只能隐约看到柔和的线条和苍白的肤色。他似乎闭着眼睛，长长的睫毛在脸上投下浅浅的阴影。\n\n没有惊天动地的气势，也没有杀气腾腾的威压。他就那样静静地悬浮在半空中，仿佛亘古以来便存在于那里，带着一种近乎虚无的宁静。周围狂暴的魔力在他出现后迅速平息，如同被无形的手抚平。\n\n光芒散去，立体法阵也随之消散。室内恢复了昏暗，只有月光透过破损的窗户洒落进来。\n\n“……召唤吗？”那个身影终于开口，声音轻柔得如同耳语，带着一种奇特的催眠般的韵律，“真是……久违的感觉。你就是我的Master吗？看起来……很特别。”\n\n他缓缓睁开眼睛，那是一双深邃如同夜空的眸子，没有瞳孔，只有无尽的黑暗，仿佛能将人的灵魂吸入其中。他看向汐颜，目光中带着一丝不易察觉的好奇。\n\n汐颜的桃色竖瞳与他对视，嘴角勾起一抹几乎看不见的弧度：“Caster。我是你的御主，白汐颜。”她顿了顿，补充道，“契约成立。如你所见，我对圣杯没有愿望。你只需协助我……观察这场战争即可。当然，若有‘有趣’的对手出现，稍微活动一下也无妨。”\n\n从者——Caster，微微歪了歪头，笼罩在他面容上的薄雾似乎随着这个动作轻轻晃动了一下：“没有愿望的御主？呵，确实很少见。观察……吗？也好，睡眠之神（Hypnos）已经沉睡了太久，偶尔醒来看看人间的戏剧，倒也不错。”\n\n虽然真名尚未完全解放，但他不经意间透露出的信息，已经足够汐颜确认他的身份。\n\n“那么，Caster，”汐颜抬手，指向窗外，“游戏开始了。让我们先找个舒适的地方，好好欣赏吧。”\n\n她转身向外走去，步伐轻快，仿佛只是邀请朋友去看一场电影。夜风吹拂着她暗红色的发梢，如同跳跃的火焰。\n\nCaster的身影如同没有重量般飘落到地面，无声无息地跟在她身后，夜空般的眼眸中，闪烁着莫测的光芒。临海市的亚种圣杯战争，随着这对奇异主从的登场，悄然拉开了序幕。\n</main_txt></content>\n<tableThink>\n<!--\n当前累计时间：距离开始已经过去了0分钟。故事刚刚开始。\n无需大总结：事件历史（表格10）为空，未达到总结阈值。\n本轮情节总结（HGW开始与召唤）：\n-

正文\n\n临海市。这座依偎着蔚蓝海岸线的现代都市，正如其名，海洋的气息无处不在，咸湿的海风终年吹拂，渗透进钢筋水泥丛林的每一处缝隙。白日里，它是车水马龙、霓虹闪烁的繁华象征；而当夜幕低垂，月光与灯火交织，便晕染开一层迷离暧昧的色调，仿佛为某些潜藏在日常之下的事物拉开了帷幕。\n\n市警察局法医中心，地下解剖室。无影灯投下过于明亮的光线，将不锈钢解剖台照得雪白刺眼。空气中弥漫着消毒水和某种难以言喻的、属于死亡的淡薄气味。白汐颜穿着标准的蓝色手术服，戴着口罩和手套，正专注地检查着解剖台上冰冷的躯体。她的动作精准、稳定，如同最精密的仪器，那双本应清澈如琉璃的灰色瞳孔，此刻却深邃得如同古井，平静地倒映着眼前的一切。\n\n她那张过分年轻，甚至可以说稚嫩的脸庞，与此刻的环境和她娴熟老练的技术形成了鲜明的对比。看起来不过十五六岁的少女，肌肤瓷白细腻，乌黑的长发被束在脑后，仅有几缕发梢带着不详的暗红色。若非亲眼所见，无人会将她与经验丰富的法医顾问联系起来。但在这里，她的权威毋庸置疑。旁边协助的警员和法医实习生们早已习惯了这位“天才少女”的作风，大气也不敢出，只是屏息等待着她的结论。\n\n“死者男性，年龄约三十至三十五岁。死亡时间初步判断在昨夜十一点到凌晨一点之间。”汐颜的声音透过口罩传出，清冷而平稳，不带一丝情感，“死因……表面看是急性心力衰竭，但疑点颇多。”她用镊子轻轻翻开死者的眼睑，仔细观察着，“瞳孔异常放大，眼底有陈旧性出血点。胸腔解剖显示心肌纤维有不自然的断裂痕迹，这与典型的心衰症状不符。”\n\n她放下镊子，目光扫过一旁的记录屏幕：“通知刑侦队，这不是简单的猝死。需要排查死者生前的社交关系、药物使用史，以及……是否有异常接触史。”\n\n“是，白顾问！”一名年轻警员连忙应道，迅速记录着要点。\n\n汐颜微微颔首，脱下手套，动作流畅地解下手术服，露出了里面简单的黑色T恤和牛仔裤。她走到洗手池边，仔细地清洗着双手，水流冲刷着白皙的皮肤。就在这时，一股极其细微、却异常清晰的波动，如同投入平静湖面的一颗石子，悄然荡漾开来。\n\n这波动并非物理层面的震动，而是更深层次的、某种遍布城市灵脉的能量潮汐的扰动。普通人对此毫无察觉，甚至绝大多数魔术师也只能模糊地感应到一丝异样。但对汐颜而言，这感觉却如同熟悉的闹钟铃声。\n\n她洗手的动作顿了顿，抬起眼，看向窗外漆黑的夜空。那双琉璃灰的瞳孔深处，似乎有什么古老的东西在苏醒。城市上空的以太浓度在以非自然的速度提升，某些节点被强行激活，沉睡的魔力如同被唤醒的巨兽，开始发出低沉的咆哮。\n\n“开始了么……”她低声自语，声音轻得只有自己能听见，“这一轮的‘游戏’。”\n\n她关掉水龙头，擦干双手，动作从容不迫，仿佛刚才感应到的只是天气预报说明天有雨一般平常。对她而言，所谓的圣杯战争，与其说是争夺万能许愿机的生死搏杀，不如说是一场……有点意思的、周期性上演的大型真人秀。而她，经历过九十九次以上轮回的存在，早已厌倦了许愿这种行为，参与其中，更多是为了观察，为了体验，或者说，纯粹是为了打发漫长得近乎永恒的时光。转世对她而言，确实不过是一场漫长的换装游戏，每一世的身份、职业，都只是她披上的一层新戏服。\n\n就在她准备离开解剖室时，右手手背上，一阵微弱的灼痛感传来。她低头看去，只见三道鲜红色的、宛如交错羽翼般的复杂纹路，正迅速地在她瓷白的肌肤上浮现、定型。令咒——御主的资格证明，以及驱使从者的绝对命令权。\n\n来了。\n\n汐颜的脸上依旧没什么表情，只是平静地注视着那三划令咒。它们散发着淡淡的魔力光辉，如同某种神秘的烙印，宣告着她已被卷入这场名为“亚种圣杯战争”的漩涡中心。但对她来说，这更像是一张……入场券。\n\n她用左手轻轻抚摸了一下令咒的纹路，指尖传来温热的触感。她能感觉到其中蕴含的庞大魔力，以及与某个未知存在的联系。“系统”已经派发了道具，接下来，就是召唤棋子了。\n\n走出警局大楼，已是深夜。海风带着凉意袭来，吹动她暗红色的发梢。街上行人稀少，远处的霓虹灯在夜色中闪烁，勾勒出都市冰冷的轮廓。汐颜没有回家，也没有去她进行虚拟主播活动的秘密据点。她熟练地掏出手机，指尖在屏幕上划过几个看似随意的图案，实则是在运行一个简化的奇门遁甲局，用以规避监控和追踪，并寻找当前时辰下，此地灵脉最为活跃、最适合进行“仪式”的节点。\n\n屏幕上很快显示出一个结果——城郊，一处废弃的气象观测站。那里地处偏僻，灵脉交汇，且常年无人问津，是进行召唤仪式的绝佳场所。\n\n她随手拦下一辆出租车，报出目的地。司机有些诧异地看了她一眼，大概觉得这么晚一个年轻女孩去那种荒地方很奇怪，但也没多问，发动了汽车。\n\n车辆驶离市区，灯火渐稀。汐颜靠在后座上，闭目养神。脑海中，无数的知识和经验如同星辰般流转。她在思考召唤的圣遗物。正统的圣杯战争需要与英灵相关的触媒，但对她而言，这并非必要。她本身的存在，她那历经无数轮回所积淀的因果和庞大信息量，就是最好的触媒。她不需要指定特定的英灵，她只需要一个……有趣的“伙伴”。\n\n她更倾向于召唤Caster职阶的从者。并非因为Caster通常战斗力较弱（这在亚种圣杯战争中并非绝对），而是因为Caster往往拥有独特的知识、诡计或规则层面的能力，这更符合她的行事风格和观察需求。她不是来战斗的，她是来“玩”的。\n\n出租车在观测站入口停下。汐颜付了车费，推门下车。废弃的观测站孤零零地矗立在山坡上，圆顶在月光下泛着陈旧的白。周围一片死寂，只有风声呜咽。\n\n汐颜信步走向观测站的主建筑。这里的灵脉果然比市区浓郁得多，空气中弥漫着活跃的魔力粒子，吸入肺中甚至有种微醺感。她找到主观测室，内部空旷，布满灰尘，只有一些锈蚀的金属支架和废弃的仪器残骸。\n\n她没有急着开始，而是先绕着房间走了一圈，指尖不时拂过墙壁、地面，甚至空气。她在勘测这里的空间结构和能量流向，用她独有的“内景窥视”结合奇门遁甲的原理，寻找最佳的仪式方位。颈椎第七节处，那枚嵌着的青铜卦爻微微发热，辅助着她的计算。\n\n“时辰……尚可。方位……坎宫，生门。能量流……稳定。”她轻声确认，最终停在房间中央偏北的位置。\n\n她伸出右手，指尖在空中虚画。没有吟唱咒文，也没有绘制传统的魔法阵。取而代之的，是随着她手指的轨迹，一道道由纯粹魔力构成的、闪耀着青蓝色光芒的线条在空中浮现、交织，形成一个复杂无比、既像星图又像卦盘的立体法阵。这正是她以奇门遁甲改良的召唤术式，直接拨动空间方位与能量节点，效率远超常规。\n\n法阵缓缓旋转，带动周围的魔力粒子加速流动，形成一个小型的能量漩涡。光芒越来越亮，将整个观测室映照得如同白昼。汐颜站在法阵中央，神色依旧平静，只是那双琉璃灰的瞳孔，不知何时已悄然转变成了妖异的桃色竖瞳，其中仿佛蕴藏着无尽的欲望与深渊。\n\n她伸出左手，掌心向上。并不需要祭品或圣遗物，她自身就是连接英灵座的桥梁。她调动起体内的魔力，那并非传统魔术师的魔力，而是更接近某种本源的、与轮回和因果相关的力量。\n\n“遵循圣杯的指引，响应我的召唤……”她的声音响起，空灵而飘渺，仿佛来自遥远的彼方，“非为胜负，非为愿望，仅为一场……观测。”\n\n“现身吧，Caster。”\n\n嗡——！\n\n立体法阵猛地爆发出刺眼的光芒，能量漩涡骤然收缩又扩散，掀起一阵无声的气浪，吹动了汐颜的发丝。光芒之中，一个模糊的人影渐渐凝聚成形。\n\n首先出现的是轮廓，修长而优雅，带着一种非人的静谧感。接着，细节开始清晰。来者似乎穿着一身古希腊式样的白色长袍，布料柔软而富有垂感，边缘绣着银色的复杂纹路，如同流动的梦境。他的身形介于少年与青年之间，面容笼罩在一层淡淡的薄雾之中，看不真切，只能隐约看到柔和的线条和苍白的肤色。他似乎闭着眼睛，长长的睫毛在脸上投下浅浅的阴影。\n\n没有惊天动地的气势，也没有杀气腾腾的威压。他就那样静静地悬浮在半空中，仿佛亘古以来便存在于那里，带着一种近乎虚无的宁静。周围狂暴的魔力在他出现后迅速平息，如同被无形的手抚平。\n\n光芒散去，立体法阵也随之消散。室内恢复了昏暗，只有月光透过破损的窗户洒落进来。\n\n“……召唤吗？”那个身影终于开口，声音轻柔得如同耳语，带着一种奇特的催眠般的韵律，“真是……久违的感觉。你就是我的Master吗？看起来……很特别。”\n\n他缓缓睁开眼睛，那是一双深邃如同夜空的眸子，没有瞳孔，只有无尽的黑暗，仿佛能将人的灵魂吸入其中。他看向汐颜，目光中带着一丝不易察觉的好奇。\n\n汐颜的桃色竖瞳与他对视，嘴角勾起一抹几乎看不见的弧度：“Caster。我是你的御主，白汐颜。”她顿了顿，补充道，“契约成立。如你所见，我对圣杯没有愿望。你只需协助我……观察这场战争即可。当然，若有‘有趣’的对手出现，稍微活动一下也无妨。”\n\n从者——Caster，微微歪了歪头，笼罩在他面容上的薄雾似乎随着这个动作轻轻晃动了一下：“没有愿望的御主？呵，确实很少见。观察……吗？也好，睡眠之神（Hypnos）已经沉睡了太久，偶尔醒来看看人间的戏剧，倒也不错。”\n\n虽然真名尚未完全解放，但他不经意间透露出的信息，已经足够汐颜确认他的身份。\n\n“那么，Caster，”汐颜抬手，指向窗外，“游戏开始了。让我们先找个舒适的地方，好好欣赏吧。”\n\n她转身向外走去，步伐轻快，仿佛只是邀请朋友去看一场电影。夜风吹拂着她暗红色的发梢，如同跳跃的火焰。\n\nCaster的身影如同没有重量般飘落到地面，无声无息地跟在她身后，夜空般的眼眸中，闪烁着莫测的光芒。临海市的亚种圣杯战争，随着这对奇异主从的登场，悄然拉开了序幕。\n</main_txt></content>\n<tableThink>\n<!--\n当前累计时间：距离开始已经过去了0分钟。故事刚刚开始。\n无需大总结：事件历史（表格10）为空，未达到总结阈值。\n本轮情节总结（HGW开始与召唤）：\n-

based on the provided character information for \"外道天魔菩萨\" (let's call her 汐颜, Xi Yan, based on the user's prompt). The setting is a Fate-style sub-species Holy Grail War (HGW).\n\n1.  **Parse User Input:**\n    *   `圣杯大小`: 大 (Large scale Grail, implies more power/potentially wider wishes possible)\n    *   `地区`: random (Will need to invent a city/location name)\n    *   `世界规则`: 真名隐藏 (Servant True Names are hidden until Noble Phantasm activation)\n    *   `个人信息`:\n        *   User Character: 汐颜 (Xi Yan), using the \"外道天魔菩萨\" character card. Surname is random.\n        *   Wish: None specified (汐颜 participates without a wish).\n        *   Occupation(s): Genius General Practitioner, Police Forensic Consultant, Virtual Streamer (海月熏 kaoru). This is a lot of simultaneous activity, needs justification or to be spaced out. Maybe she uses clones, high efficiency via powers, or it's a cover. The \"外道天魔菩萨\" card suggests reincarnation and adaptation, fitting for juggling identities. Feng Hou Qi Men could explain efficient commuting/scheduling. Polymath ability supports diverse expertise.\n    *   Implicit Requirement: Start the story, likely beginning with the HGW starting or Servant summoning.\n\n2.  **Setup and Initialization:**\n    *   **Location:** Create a plausible city name that blends modernity and potential for mystical elements. Let's call it \"Linhai City\" (临海市 - \"City by the Sea\"), implying a coastal location which can have unique ley lines.\n    *   **Character Introduction:** Start with 汐颜 in one of her roles, perhaps feeling the HGW's beginning or preparing for summoning. Introduce her through actions and environment reflecting her character card (calm exterior, maybe a hint of her ancient nature, using powers subtly).\n    *   **HGW Start:** The Grail system activates. Masters are chosen (or confirmed if pre-chosen). Command Spells appear.\n    *   **Summoning:** 汐颜 needs to perform a summoning ritual. The character card doesn't specify a preferred Servant or catalyst, but her nature might attract specific types (perhaps related to desires, cycles, trickery, or enlightenment/corruption). Given her lack of a wish, her participation motive might be observation, manipulation, or simply experiencing this \"game.\"\n    *   **Servant Selection:** Need to create a Servant for 汐颜. It should complement her abilities and theme. Given her \"外道天魔菩萨\" nature (heretical/deviant celestial demon bodhisattva), a Caster, Assassin, or even a unique Berserker could fit. Let's go with Caster for synergy with her own numerology/magic-like abilities. The Servant should be relatively unknown or have a deceptive nature to align with the hidden True Name rule. Let's invent a Caster based on a figure known for illusion, manipulation, or hidden knowledge. Maybe a figure related to dreams or hidden histories? Let's select **Hypnos**, the Greek God of Sleep, fitting her desire manipulation and hidden knowledge themes. His abilities could involve illusions, mental manipulation, and information gathering through dreams.\n    *   **Random Surname:** Generate a random Chinese surname for 汐颜. Let's pick \"白\" (Bai). So, 白汐颜 (Bai Xi Yan).\n\n3.  **Narrative Flow (Opening Scene):**\n    *   Start in Linhai City. Maybe 汐颜 is finishing a shift at the hospital or doing forensic work, showcasing her mundane identity.\n    *   Subtle signs of the HGW beginning: a surge in local mana, unusual occurrences reported (perhaps related to other Masters/Servants starting to act).\n    *   汐颜 notices these signs due to her abilities (内景窥视?). She might consult her Feng Hou Qi Men for confirmation.\n    *   Command Spells appear on her hand. Describe this moment – is she surprised? Indifferent? Her motto suggests indifference.\n    *   Transition to her preparing the summoning ritual. Location: maybe a secluded place she owns, imbued with her power, or a strategically chosen ley line node.\n    *   Describe the ritual setup. Does she use traditional magic circles, or something adapted with her own unique methods (奇门遁甲 integration)?\n    *   The summoning: Light, power, the Servant appears. Describe Hypnos's initial appearance. He likely manifests in a deceptive form initially.\n    *   Initial dialogue: Establish their Master-Servant dynamic. Hypnos might be intrigued by her nature. She might be analytical or detached.\n\n4.  **Refine Details based on Character Card:**\n    *   **Appearance:** Emphasize her youthful look vs. ancient eyes/aura. Note the potential shift in eye color if her desires are stirred by the HGW. The bronze trigram on her neck is a key detail.\n    *   **Abilities:** Show, don't just tell. Perhaps she uses Feng Hou Qi Men subtly to arrange the ritual space perfectly or uses 内景窥视 to sense the summoned Servant's nature before they fully materialize.\n    *   **Behavior:** Show her calm, analytical approach (checking the time for optimal summoning?). Maybe her ritual space has ancient texts with her handwritten notes in the margins.\n    *   **Weakness:** The need to change identities isn't immediately relevant but informs her long-term behavior.\n\n5.  **Table Initialization (Crucial):**\n    *   **Table 0 (Current Info):** Set initial time (0 minutes), location (Linhai City, specific ritual spot), active characters (汐颜, Caster/Hypnos).\n    *   **Table 3 (Character Info):** Add 汐颜 using `insertRow`. Fill all columns based on the character card and generated surname. Physical: 156cm, specific measurements, porcelain skin, black/red hair, grey/peach eyes, neck mark, white tiger, 16 physical age, 99+ cycles real age. Personality: Calm, analytical, ancient, manipulative, curious? Occupation: Doctor/Forensic/Vtuber. Hobbies: Ancient texts, observing humanity? Preferences: Efficiency, knowledge? Residence: Variable/Hidden. Notes: Reincarnator, Feng Hou Qi Men, Puja Form (detailed), Polymath skills (detailed), identity change weakness, perfect disguise record. Relationships: Initial: 汐颜|Caster(Master/Servant). Attitude: Analytical/Curious. Favorability: Neutral start (e.g., 汐颜|Caster(50%/0%/70%/0%)). Emotional State: Calmly observing, perhaps mild anticipation for the \"game\". Core Need: Experience/Observation/Manipulation? Trauma: None explicitly stated, perhaps weariness from endless cycles.\n    *   **Table 3 (Character Info):** Add Caster (Hypnos) using `insertRow`. Define his stats (likely high Magic, low physical), skills (Illusion, Dream Manipulation, Territory Creation?), NP (related to inducing sleep/dreams). Physical: Define an initial appearance (maybe ethereal, nondescript). Personality: Enigmatic, calm, perhaps slightly mischievous or detached. Occupation: Servant (God of Sleep). Notes: True Name hidden. Relationships: Caster|汐颜(Servant/Master). Attitude: Curious/Observant. Favorability: Caster|汐颜(50%/0%/60%/0%). Emotional State: Assessing Master and situation. Core Need: Observation? Peace? Something fitting for Sleep.\n    *   **Table 1 (Clothing/Action):** Describe 汐颜's clothing during the ritual (something practical yet fitting her adaptable style? Maybe simple dark clothes) and her actions (performing the ritual). Describe Caster's initial manifestation and pose.\n    *   **Table 2 (Thoughts):** 汐颜's thoughts: Assessing the summoned Servant, confirming the ritual's success according to her calculations. Caster's thoughts: Analyzing the summoner – sensing her unusual nature.\n    *   **Table 5 (Abilities):** Add 汐颜's abilities (Feng Hou Qi Men, Puja Form, Polymath) with details from the card. Add Caster's core abilities/skills.\n    *   **Table 9 (World Rules):** Add the rule about hidden True Names. Setter: System/亚种圣杯战争. Effect: Servant True Names are concealed until Noble Phantasm activation. Add the 4-Servant kill requirement for Grail activation. Add the 7-day time limit.\n    *   **Table 10 (Event History):** Add the first event: 汐颜 summons Caster in Linhai City at the start of the HGW.\n\n6.  **Word Count Management:** The target is 2000-2200 words for `<content><main_txt>`. The initial scene (preparation, summoning, first interaction) needs significant descriptive detail to reach this length. Expand on the environment, the ritual's sensory details (light, sounds, mana fluctuations), 汐颜's precise actions and subtle expressions, the Servant's manifestation process, and their initial exchange. Flesh out internal thoughts (Table 2) and descriptions (Table 1) considerably. Describe Linhai City atmosphere briefly to set the stage.\n\n7.  **Constraint Checklist & Confidence Score:**\n    *   Strict Learning Compliance: Yes.\n    *   Setting Compliance (<information>): Yes.\n    *   No Stagnation: Yes, starting the HGW and summoning is progress.\n    *   Detailed Description: Yes, required for word count.\n    *   Chinese Output Only: Yes.\n    *   Internal Consistency: Yes, mapping character card to actions.\n    *   Innovation/No Repetition: Yes, new story.\n    *   Varied Structure: Yes, blend description, action, dialogue.\n    *   Character Knowledge Limits: Yes, True Names hidden.\n    *   Ending Control: Yes, avoid summarizing/concluding with 汐颜's thoughts/actions.\n    *   Word Count (2000-2200): High confidence, achievable through detailed description.\n    *   Output Format: Yes, will follow `<now_plot>`, `<now_information>`, `<plot_summary>`, `<status_format>`.\n    *   Table Rules: Yes, initial population using `insertRow`.\n    *   COT Style: Following the detailed multi-agent simulation format.\n    *   Initial Character Introduction: Yes, follow rules.\n    *   `<tableThink>` & `<tableEdit>` Format: Yes, follow strict rules.\n\n8.  **Final Plan:** Start the story. Establish Linhai City. Introduce 白汐颜, showcase a facet of her life while she senses the HGW. Depict the Command Spells appearing. Detail her preparation and execution of the summoning ritual using her unique skills. Describe the Caster (Hypnos) summoning and their first interaction, setting the stage for the HGW. Ensure all descriptions are detailed enough to meet the word count.
